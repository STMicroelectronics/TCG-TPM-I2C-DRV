# TCG-TPM-I2C-DRV
Linux driver for I2C TPM compliant with TCG specification
I2C TPM driver is natively in linux kernel since 6.1.
We provide overlay file to simplify TPM activation.

## Advising
Select branch 5.4.y and 5.10.y, for your legacy linux branch to integrate a driver for an STMicroelectronics TPM with an IÂ²C interface.

## TPM activation by overlay file

directly after flash your sd card :
### Copy tpm-stm.dtbo file in "overlays" directory 
### merge or modify config.txt
#### remove  # on (to activate SPI and I2C bus)
dtparam=i2c_arm=on

dtparam=spi=on
#### add (to activate I2C and SPI TPM driver)
dtoverlay=tpm-stm

### Tested with :

#### Platform :
Raspberry Pi 3B+, Raspberry Pi 4B, Raspberry Pi 5
#### OS : 
Raspbian 
#### Linux kernel version : 
6.1 , downloaded from https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux
